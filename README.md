## App: allow users to input an opening line and potentially some of their profile info / the profile info of the person they are interested in, to generate a score (probability of a meaningful conversation)

## Naive approach: OpenAI API, directly ask ChatGPT to rate an opening line based on my profile and the person of interest's profile

## ML approach: HMMs?

## Deep Learning Approach: prompt engineering or/and fine-tuning 

## Evaluation: since the output is a probability, we can use traditional train/test split
